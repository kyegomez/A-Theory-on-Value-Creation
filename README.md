## Why I Wrote This Paper

In today’s rapidly evolving economy, traditional models of value creation are being outpaced by the exponential growth in technology, the rising importance of intangible assets, and the shift towards knowledge-based industries. While classical economic theories provided foundational insights, there is a growing need to develop a modern framework that accounts for the complexities of today’s global economy.

I wrote **"A Theory on Value Creation"** to bridge the gap between traditional economic models and the contemporary economic landscape, where innovation, networks, human capital, and technological advancements play pivotal roles in value creation. This paper formalizes a comprehensive framework for understanding how both tangible and intangible resources interact with technology and time to generate value. It integrates theoretical rigor with practical applications across microeconomic, macroeconomic, and sector-specific contexts.
